# balances
ERC20 tokens and the balance
To implement a simple web server with a GET endpoint that returns the balances of all ERC20 tokens and the balance of Ethereum native tokens for a given address
Replace "your-infura-project-id" with your own Infura project ID.
Make a GET request to http://localhost:3000/balances/0xA145ac099E3d2e9781C9c848249E2e6b256b030D (replace the address with the one you want to query).
The response will be a JSON object with the balances of Ether, DAI, BAT, and REP tokens for the given address.
